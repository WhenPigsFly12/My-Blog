      <p class="text-muted">A Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible</p>

      <p class="text-muted">It is a wonderful place. Must visit this place. Hiring a tour guide will be better to understand the stories of such a historical place. It is a beautifully maintained small complex with yellow painted walls. It is a historical site and famous among tourists. It contains a number of different devices that were used to measure time in different eras in the Indian history. It has a nominal ticket price of ₹15 for Indians but about ₹225-250 for foreigners. Nice place to visit. We had an incredible experience visiting this observatory and seeing the accuracy of the astronomical instruments built around 300 years ago.</p>

        A victory lap that moonwalks through the best part of the MCU back catalogue and emphasises emotion as much
        as action, this is an intensely satisfying piece of blockbuster filmmaking. The culmination of 10 years and
         more than twice as many movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, “Avengers: Endgame” promises closure where
          its predecessor, “Avengers: Infinity War,” sowed chaos. That film — which revealed that the cookie-cutter
           uniformity of all those MCU movies had been part of an unprecedented master plan — infamously wrapped 
           with a snap: a gesture that, when performed by a supervillain armed with the six Infinity Stones, was 
           capable of wiping out half of all life in the universe.

          The great circle of life has thrown up a gorgeous, star-studded story, but trading feeling
            for realism means that we lose something of the original film’s excellence.Another month, another
            Disney remake of an animated classic. There are two reasons that this film exists, and neither is
            because anything was missing from 1994’s furry Hamlet. The first is to show off genuinely 
            dazzling visual effects, technological marvels that give us photo-real animals in an absolutely
             convincing setting. The second is to showcase the ability of Disney and director Jon Favreau, 
             following 2016’s reimagining of The Jungle Book, to assemble a world-class voice cast. But it’s 
             still not enough to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the great king of the past.
